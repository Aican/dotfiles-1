# Installation

## Bootstrapper

The bootstrapper depends on three things: ruby, rake, and bundler. Assuming you
have ruby and ruby gems installed on your system: `gem install rake bundler`.
Then:

    bash < <( curl http://github.com/gf3/dotfiles/raw/master/bootstrap.sh )

Don't worry, all your old files will be backed up!

# Stay Updated

Rake tasks!

    cd ~/.dotfiles
    rake update install
